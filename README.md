# leetcode-solution-quant-developer

This repository contains my personal LeetCode solutions designed to strengthen core algorithmic and data-structure skills required for Quant Developer, Trading, and System Design interview roles.

Each problem includes:
- ✔ Multi-language implementations (Python, C++, Java)
  
- ✔ Clean, optimized code
  
- ✔ Clear explanations and complexity analysis
  
- ✔ Organized structure for easy navigation

This project serves both as a study log and a reference for future interview preparation.
